## Materials
Each participant will use the following materials to create their own illuminated backpack (or other decorated item):
- Circuit Playground Express (CPX) microcontroller
- LED "pebble light" string assembly terminated with ring terminals
- Woven drawstring cord - long enough to cover the LED string
- 3D printed CPX case
- 3 M3x6mm nylon screws and nuts to attach ring terminals to CPX
- 2 additional M3 screws to secure CPX in printed case
- Battery pack with slide power switch and 3xAA batteries
- JST extension cable
- Needle and thread to sew 3D printed case to backpack. May be used to sew LED string to bag as well.
- Small white zip ties to attach LED string to mesh bag panel (if you prefer not to sew)
